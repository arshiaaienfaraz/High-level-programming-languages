/*  
Write three functions swap_v(int,int), swap_r(int&,int&), and swap_ cr(const int&, const int&). 
Each should have the body
    { int temp; temp = a, a=b; b=temp; }
where a and b are the names of the arguments. 
Try calling each swap like this:
    int x = 7; 
    int y =9; 
    swap_?(x,y); // replace ? by v, r, or cr 
    swap_?(7,9); 
    const int cx = 7; 
    const int cy = 9; 
    swap_?(cx,cy); 
    swap_?(7.7,9.9); 
    double dx = 7.7; 
    double dy = 9.9; 
    swap_?(dx,dy); 
    swap_?(7.7,9.9);
Which  functions  and calls  compiled,  and  why?  
After  each  swap  that  compiled,  print  the value  of  the  arguments  
after  the  call  to  see  if  they  were  actually  swapped.  
If  you  are surprised by a result, consult §8.6.
